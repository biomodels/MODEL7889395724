# Model Notes


This is the model described in the article:  
**Reconstruction of the action potential of ventricular myocardial fibres.**   
Beeler GW, Reuter H. _J Physiol._ 1977 Jun;268(1):177-210. Pubmed ID:
[874889](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/874889) , [full
text](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1283659) at
PubMed central (PMCID:PMC1283659).  
**Abstract:**   
1\. A mathematical model of membrane action potentials of mammalian
ventricular myocardial fibres is described. The reconstruction model is based
as closely as possible on ionic currents which have been measured by the
voltage-clamp method.  
2\. Four individual components of ionic current were formulated mathematically
in terms of Hodgkin-Huxley type equations. The model incorporates two voltage-
and time-dependent inward currents, the excitatory inward sodium current,
i(Na), and a secondary or slow inward current, i(s), primarily carried by
calcium ions. A time-independent outward potassium current, i(K1), exhibiting
inward-going rectification, and a voltage- and time-dependent outward current,
i(x1), primarily carried by potassium ions, are further elements of the model.  
3\. The i(Na) is primarily responsible for the rapid upstroke of the action
potential, while the other current components determine the configuration of
the plateau of the action potential and the re-polarization phase. The
relative importance of inactivation of i(s) and of activation of i(x1) for
termination of the plateau is evaluated by the model.  
4\. Experimental phenomena like slow recovery of the sodium system from
inactivation, frequency dependence of the action potential duration, all-or-
nothing re-polarization, membrane oscillations are adequately described by the
model.  
5\. Possible inadequacies and shortcomings of the model are discussed.
